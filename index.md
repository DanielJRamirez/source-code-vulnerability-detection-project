## Source Code Vulnerability Detection

### Abstract

In order to better understand and compare the techniques that are being developed to detect vulnerabilities in source codes, eight papers were selected to be researched and five were implemented. These papers each present different methods and operate on varying datasets and languages, however a selection of common metrics allows for adequate comparisons in their efficacy. This comparison helps to showcase the most successful individual strategies and overall implementations that can be applied to detect flaws in software.
