# Source Code Vulnerability Detection Project

## Summary
This project was aimed at studying and implementing various researchers' methodologies of detecting vulnerabilities within source code. Five of the methods that were studied were also implemented. Each is located within a separate directory in this project. None of the software in this repository is original to this project. It belongs to the corresponding cited authors within the READMEs of each directory.

## Running this project
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DanielJRamirez/source-code-vulnerability-detection-project.git
   ```
2. Enter the director of the desired code implementation
   ```sh
   cd target_directory_here
   ```
 
 3. Follow the instructions found in the target directory's README
