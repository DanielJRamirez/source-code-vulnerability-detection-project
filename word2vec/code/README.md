# Detecting Software Vulnerabilities with Deep Learning
### Researched by Laura Wartschinksi

## Overview
71 Github Python github repositories are analyzed to try to identify 7 common vulnerabilities, listed below. [Word2Vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec), commonly used for natural language processing, is used for vectorization of commits from each repository.
#### 7 Vulnerabilities 
* SQL Injection
* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Cross-site request forgery (XSRF)
* Path Disclosure
* Open Redirect
* Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* Command Injection

## Methodology Overview
Data is collected using [PyDriller](https://pydriller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to mine various Github repositories and create a corpus. The corpus is cleaned, tokenized, and merged with some configurations options available before finally being trained and stored as a word2vec model.

The LSTM models for each vulnerability are trained by scraping Github via the Github API with a focus on natural code bases in Python. That is to say, exclude intentional vulnerabilities (eg proofs of concept) as much as possible and refer to commits in Python.
Once the data is collected and cleaned, it is randomly split into training, validating, and final testing sets at 70%, 15% and 15% splits respectively.

The LSTM model is created for each vulnerability using the word2vec model(s) from before.

## Requirements
#### Note - All scripts ran on a 64-bit Arch Linux machine in an [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) environment
I had a hard time getting this to work due to various packages requiring specific versions. Numpy, PyDriller, and Tensorflow seem to be the most strict in their version requirements.
The following should be installed in a Python environment. A requirements.txt is provided in this repository though is the full environment used and not all packages are necessary.
* Gensim = 3.8.3
* Scikit Learn = 0.24.2
* Pillow = 8.3.2
* keras = 2.3.1
* pydot = 1.4.2
* graphviz = 2.24.3
* nltk = 3.6.7

##### Be sure to downgrade to these versions if necessary
* PyDriller = 1.18.15
* NumPy = 1.18.5
* Tensorflow = 1.14.0
